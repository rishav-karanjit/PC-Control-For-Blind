# PC Control For Differently Abled People

### Problems
<ul>
  <li>Differently abled people find difficult to use computer.</li>
  <li>Windows accessibility features requires some usage of keyboard(for eg: to start it) which will be difficult for visually impaired or people who can't use keyboard or mouse.</li>
  <li>It is very difficult or impossible to open apps, write in MS Word, surf internet and do many more stuffs in computer.</li>
  <li>There are some softwares like JAWS screen reader but it is not free.</li>
</ul>

### Solutions
<ul>
  <li>This application uses voice input. So I think it will be very helpful specially for visually impaired people and people who can't use keyboard.</li>
  <li>This application starts right after the windows have started. So, there won't be any need to use keyboard even to start the app.</li>
  <li>I have made this application to be able to open apps, read or write MS word file and even to browse internet.</li>
  <li>This app is completely free. Download git repo and use it.</li>  
</ul>
